recom_1: Simulated theta, 10 repeats put into train after each new recommendation
recom_2: Simulated theta, 1 repeat put into train after each new recommendation
recom_3: fast method, 10 repeats
recom_4: fast method, 1 repeat
mutation: 150 mutation from known hits
mix:     take 10 from each recommendation method and use Pu's idea to generate peptides

Note: csv files with "AA" in their title are files documenting recommended peptide sequences
