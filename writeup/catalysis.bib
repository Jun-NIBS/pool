"Mike is better to judge papers on this that you can look at, but I'm attaching the one that describes a related peptide to what we hope to find, that was found by phage display (a genetic combinatorial library approach that links peptide sequence to DNA-code, and can hence byisolated from low concentration hits via PCR amplification.)
        
In other words. It's an approach for searching huge amounts of sequence space in long sequencesand extracting hits."},

abstract = {We present an approximation to a molecule's N-dimensional conformational probability density function (pdf) in terms of marginal pdfs of highest order l, where l is much less than N. The approximation is constructed as a product of conditional pdfs derived by recursive application of the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented to sample conformations from the approximate full-dimensional pdf based upon all input marginal pdfs. The sampling algorithm is tested for three small molecule systems by using the algorithm to sample conformations at levels l=1, 2, or 3 and comparing the distributions of sampled conformations with those from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The distributions of conformations sampled at third (l=3) order resemble the MD distributions rather well and significantly better than those sampled at second (l=2) or first (l=1) order. In addition to highlighting the importance of correlations among internal degrees of freedom, these results suggest that low-order correlations suffice to describe most of the conformational fluctuations of molecules in a thermal environment.},

@article{Killian2007,
abstract = {A method is presented for extracting the configurational entropy of solute molecules from molecular dynamics simulations, in which the entropy is computed as an expansion of multidimensional mutual information terms, which account for correlated motions among the various internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The mutual information expansion is demonstrated to be equivalent to estimating the full-dimensional configurational probability density function (PDF) using the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation (GKSA). While the mutual information expansion is derived to the full dimensionality of the molecule, the current application uses a truncated form of the expansion in which all fourth- and higher-order mutual information terms are neglected. Truncation of the mutual information expansion at the nth order is shown to be equivalent to approximating the full-dimensional PDF using joint PDFs with dimensionality of n or smaller by successive application of the GKSA. The expansion method is used to compute the absolute (classical) configurational entropy in a basis of bond-angle-torsion internal coordinates for several small molecules as well as the change in entropy upon binding for a small host-guest system. Convergence properties of the computed entropy values as a function of simulation time are investigated and comparisons are made with entropy values from the second generation Mining Minima software. These comparisons demonstrate a deviation in -TS of no more than about 2 kcal/mol for all cases in which convergence has been obtained.},
