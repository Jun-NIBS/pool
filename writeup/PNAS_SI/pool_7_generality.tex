\subsection{Generality of Approach} \label{sec:generality}
\jwcomment{address comment here} While we proposed a Naive Bayes model for prediction in \ref{sec:stat model}, the optimal learning approach that we proposed is rather general and applies to any machine learning model as long as it allows calculation of the objective in \eqref{eq:reduced form}, for example, you can easily plug in common machine learning classifiers like logistic regression, SVM with probabilistic output, etc. The result of performance guarantee of the greedy algorithm in \ref{sec:lower bound} and the reduced form of greedy algorithm in \ref{sec:reduced form} applies, too.
