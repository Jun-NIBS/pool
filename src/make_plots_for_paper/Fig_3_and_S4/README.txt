The files in this directory creates these figures in the manuscript:
* Fig 3 in the main paper ("Simulated method performance comparison and diversity evaluation")
* Fig S4 in the supplement ("Distances in simulation study...")

It uses raw data from the directory FIG3CD/
This raw data was produced using a previously-run simulation.

It processes them using the python notebook
Fig 3 Nature Communications Python Notebook.ipynb

It produces as output these files.  The first four of these were processed to produce Fig3 in the main paper.
The last two (despite their name) were processed to produce Fig S4 in the supplement.  (They are named this way because we originally intended them to appear together with the others in a bigger version of figure 3.)

Creates Fig 3:
fig3a.eps
fig3b.eps
fig3c.eps
fig3d.eps

Creates Fig S4:
fig3e.eps
fig3f.eps

ps and pdf versions of these files were then created.
Finally, fig3e.pdf and fig3f.pdf were manually processed to modify the legend, creating FigS4A.pdf and FigS4B.pdf
