Peter created this directory on 5/28/2014 to store some files used to create
histograms in the presentation orthogonal_peptide_result_analysis.pptx, for
showing histograms of the integrated light intensity under the previous
normalization method.  The presentation contrasted this previous normalization
method with a new one that Jialei put together.
