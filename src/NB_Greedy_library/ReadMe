Currently, this small library has three .R files:

(a)Naive_Bayes_util.R
(b)Opt_Search_util.R
(c)utility.R

(a)Naive_Bayes_util.R:
    Contains functions that conducts basical functionalities of the NB model: 
	    get features from original data; 
	    model training; 
	    prediction; 
	    probability of improvement(PI) and expected improvement(EI) computation.

    Function List:
        1. Naive_Bayes 
        2. getFeatures 
        3. getTheta_MC 
        4. getTheta 
        5. Dirichlet_Parameter 
        6. NB_predict 



(b)Opt_Search_util.R:
    Contains functions that generate a set of recommendations using greedy heuristics.

    Function List:
        1. maxP_search 
        2. maxP_search 
        3. maxP_search_MAP 
        4. ExpImprovement_par 


(c)Utility.R:
Functions serve as a user-interface: input the file names and parameters to get recommendation files or ROC plots.

    Function List:
        1. Recom_Generation 
        2. writePep 
        3. muteGen 
        4. ROC_plot 


How to:
To use this lab, in an R working environment, always run this command 
	source('NB_Greedy_lib.R')
first. Make sure the three files (a),(b) and (c) must be put in the same folder as 'NB_Greedy_lib.R')

(1) To generate a set of recommendations, call the function 'Recom_Generation'. See its function description in file (a)utility.R

(2) To generate a ROC plot, call the function 'ROC_plot'. See its funciton description in file(a)utility.R

(3) To do cross validation , enter the foler NB_Greedy_library and run the following commands in the terminal:
$chmod 755 crossValidation.sh
$chmod 755 data_collect.sh

Then type ./crossValidation.sh to submit a series of jobs on NBS system. After all jobs are finished, run ./data_collect.sh to collect the outputs. This will generate a file output in list of probabilities required by the function 'ROC_plot'.
