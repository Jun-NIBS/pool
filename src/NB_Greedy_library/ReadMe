Currently, this small library has three .R files:

(a)Naive_Bayes_util.R
(b)Opt_Search_util.R
(c)utility.R

(a)Naive_Bayes_util.R:
Contains functions that conducts basical functionalities of the NB model: 
	get features from original data; 
	model training; 
	prediction; 
	probability of improvement(PI) and expected improvement(EI) computation.


(b)Opt_Search_util.R:
Contains functions that generate a set of recommendations using greedy heuristics.


(c)Utility.R:
Functions serve as a user-interface: input the file names and parameters to get recommendation files or ROC plots.


How to:
To use this lab, in an R working environment, always run this command 
	source('NB_Greedy_lib.R')
first. Make sure the three files (a),(b) and (c) must be put in the same folder as 'NB_Greedy_lib.R')

(1) To generate a set of recommendations, call the function 'Recom_Generation'. See its function description in file (a)utility.R

(2) To generate a ROC plot, call the function 'ROC_plot'. See its funciton description in file(a)utility.R

(3) To do cross validation, enter the foler NB_Greedy_library and run 
	./crossValidation.sh 
    to submit a series of jobs on NBS system and run 
	./data_collect.sh 
    to process the outputs. This will generate a list of probabilities required by the function 'ROC_plot'.
